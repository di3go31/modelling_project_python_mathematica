# modelling_project_python_mathematica
Python and Mathematica components of the battlefield modelling project, as part of my MX4553 Modelling theory course. Tasks included cleaning csv data sets, importing into Mathematica, creating data Visualisations in Mathematica, a python simulation to help answer which factor affects the strategy of a battlefield the most.
